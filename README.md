# EECS 348 – Lab 9: C++ Programming (Matrix Operations)

## Overview
This lab implements several matrix operations in C++ to practice file I/O, loops, conditionals, and functions.  
The program reads two matrices from a file, performs operations, and displays results in a formatted output.

## Features
1. Load two N×N matrices from file  
2. Add and multiply matrices  
3. Calculate sums of main and secondary diagonals  
4. Swap rows and columns  
5. Update a matrix element  

## Files
- **main.cpp** – C++ source code implementing all functionality  
- **Makefile** – Builds the executable using `g++`  
- **matrix_input.txt** – Sample input file containing matrix data  

## Compilation
Run the following commands:
```bash
make
